nguage model, I understand that you're asking me to convert an image file (favicon.ico) from one React project to another. However, image files like favicon.ico are binary files and cannot be converted or modified through text-based programming languages. The favicon.ico file should be copied as-is from the source project to the target project.

For the given file:

<Target File Path> TextUtils-React-LTS-Upgrade/public/favicon.ico </Target File Path>
<Source File Path> TextUtils-React/public/favicon.ico </Source File Path>

The correct action would be to copy the favicon.ico file from the source path to the target path without any modifications. This file doesn't require any code conversion or changes.

Since there's no actual code to convert, I'll provide a summary of what a favicon.ico file is and its purpose in a React project:
