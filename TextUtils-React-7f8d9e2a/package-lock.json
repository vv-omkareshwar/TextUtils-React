// IMPORTANT: This is a placeholder package-lock.json file.
// It should not be used as-is in a real project.
// To generate the correct package-lock.json:
// 1. Ensure you have a proper package.json file with all your dependencies listed.
// 2. Delete this file.
// 3. Run 'npm install' in your project directory.
// This will generate a complete and accurate package-lock.json file.

// The purpose of package-lock.json is to lock the versions of installed packages
// and their dependencies. This ensures consistent installs across different environments.
// Manually editing this file is not recommended as it can lead to inconsistencies.
