with the conversion, I'll need the content of the current file (Navbar.js). Without the actual code, I cannot perform the conversion or provide a meaningful output. Could you please provide the content of the Navbar.js file?

Once I have the file content, I'll be able to analyze it, convert it according to the specified requirements, and provide the converted code along with any necessary dependencies and a summary
