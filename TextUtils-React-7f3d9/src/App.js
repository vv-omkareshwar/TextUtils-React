d that you want me to convert the file at the path TextUtils-React-7f3d9/src/App.js. However, you haven't provided the actual content of this file. Without the source code, I can't perform the conversion. 

If you could provide the content of the App.js file, I'd be happy to convert it according to the specified requirements, ensuring it adheres to React and React Router standards, and follows the coding standards you've outlined.

Once I have the source code, I'll analyze it, make the necessary conversions, and provide you with the converted code along with any required dependencies and a detailed summary of the file's functionality and structure
