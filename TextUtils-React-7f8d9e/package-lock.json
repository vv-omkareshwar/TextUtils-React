d that you're asking me to convert the `package-lock.json` file. However, `package-lock.json` is a file automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree or `package.json`. It's not typically a file that needs to be converted or modified manually.

In the context of converting a React project to another framework or language, the `package-lock.json` file would be regenerated based on the new `package.json` and the dependencies installed for the new project.

Therefore, instead of converting this file, the appropriate action would be to create a new project in the target framework/language and let it generate its own lock file or equivalent.

If you're converting the entire React project to another framework or language, you would need to:

1. Set up a new project in the target framework/language.
2. Define the equivalent dependencies in the new project's package management system.
3. Let the new package manager generate its own lock file or equivalent.

Without knowing the target framework or language, I can't provide a specific converted file. However, I can provide a summary of what the `package-lock.json` file represents:
